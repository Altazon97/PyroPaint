--- INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PYRO PAINT ---

1.  Pyro Paint requires particular dependencies along with version 2.7 of the Python language.  Download the
    required modules for use with Pyro Paint according to your operating system.

    ---> EasyGUI 0.96:  http://easygui.sourceforge.net/download/version_0.96/index.html
    ---> Pygame 1.9.1:  http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
    ---> Python 2.7:    http://www.python.org/getit/
    
    These links are for your information.  The source files for Pygame and EasyGUI are included, unmodified, in
    /modules/EasyGUI and /modules/Pygame.
   
2.  This next step applies to both libraries.  Extract the contents from the archive containing the source.  Open
    a Terminal window, and navigate to the directory that the extrction is contained in.  Type:
    
    cd /directory/to/extraction
    python setup.py install
  
    Sometimes you are required to have root privileges to run setup.py.  Append the above command on to "sudo" in
    Linux, or run Command Prompt as an Administrator in Windows.  Please see the documentation on these modules
    for full installation support.
    
3.  Ensure the Pyro Paint folder configuration is unmodified before starting the software.  /imgs is required for displaying
    images.  Launch "PyroPaint.py" graphically or, type "python PyroPaint.py" in a Terminal window inside the directory.
    

Enjoy!
